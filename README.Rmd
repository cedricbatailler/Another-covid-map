<!-- badges: end -->

This demo project was mostly motivated by the desire to test the `gggibbous` R package.

![A map of vaccination rate per department in France](export/plot.png)

The code for the map sleeps in `map.R`. The project was inspired by Cedric Scherer [2020/32 TidyTuesday contribution](https://github.com/z3tt/TidyTuesday/tree/master/plots/2020_32).
